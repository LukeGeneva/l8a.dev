<p>I provide this page here in case you are wondering how this site is made. It&#39;s
fairly simple, but requires some explanation.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a web developer by trade, but I&#39;ve grown pretty tired of the overkill,
over-engineering, call it what you will that&#39;s out there. I don&#39;t want to learn
another framework. I don&#39;t want to figure out another templating system. I don&#39;t
want to fiddle around with a static site generator. Don&#39;t get me wrong, some of
the stuff out there is great, but at the end of the day, this site just has to
display requested content.</p>
<p>It&#39;s all static content. The blog articles are written in markdown. The pages
are written in plain HTML. I use Tailwind for styling because it&#39;s just that
easy. There&#39;s a small build process that produces the functioning site, which
currently is hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<h2>Blog Posts</h2>
<p>I write them in markdown and convert them to HTML with
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked">marked</a>. The conversion is part of the
build process and the rendered HTML files get placed in <code>docs/blog</code>.</p>
