<p>May 31, 2024</p>
<p>I had the sudden urge recently to Google a trivial matter such as, &quot;How to read
more books,&quot; as if there were some profound insight to that query &quot;Read more,&quot;
of course is the answer here.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a silly question, but it&#39;s something I assume most of us have done,
including myself -- a number of times, in fact. In the moment, it feels right,
my thinking at the time being that there may be some unknown habit I&#39;m partaking
in that could be interfering with my ability to have adequate time for reading
available. Hindsight being what it is, this assumption could very well be
correct, with the silly internet search itself being the unfortunate habit I am
so earnestly seeking out.</p>
<p>This is an unfortunate consequence of having a world of information readily at
hand. It feels as though you may be able to find some nugget of information that
will be an invaluable resource to help you along the path you are on. The best
information comes from direct observation. E.M. Forster warned about this type
of thinking in <a href="https://amzn.to/3Vnuizy"><em>The Machine Stops</em></a> clear back in
1909, before the internet was even dreamed of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your descendants will be even in a better position than you, for they will
learn what you think I think, and yet another intermediate will be added to
the chain. And in time&quot;--his voice rose--&quot;there will come a generation that
had got beyond facts, beyond impressions, a generation absolutely colorless, a
generation <em>seraphically free from taint of personality,</em> which will see the
French Revolution not as it happened, but as it would have happened, had it
taken place in the days of the Machine.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Direct experience, of course, should hold a far greater position in our minds
than second-hand tips and tricks, although it can be hard to convince yourself
otherwise in the moment.</p>
<p>How do you read more books?
Become a better reader.</p>
<p>How do you become a better reader?
Read.</p>
<p>It&#39;s that direct observation, that direct experience, that propels you forward.
It requires the most work, but reaps the greatest reward. It&#39;s rewarding.</p>
<p>Remember that the path you are on is <em>your</em> path. Searching for advice so
readily can easily pull you away from that path. The internet is many things,
but a place of nuance, it is not. The extremes are pulled to the surface, and
the solutions to most problems are not found in extremes, but in nuance -- in
outputs highly dependent upon their inputs and the variables of the problem at
hand.</p>
<p>My question was a lazy question, one whose sole purpose was to make the going
easier. If you get out what you put in, what good are such questions? Instead,
let the practice lead the theory. Learn by discovery. Seek out primary sources.
Let narratives be the supplement, not the diet.</p>
<p>When in doubt, the best way to move forward is to simply get to work. Out of the
work will come the insights, the tricks of the trade, the invaluable informative
resources such as I was trying to extract undeservedly.</p>
<p>Work smarter, not harder, but the key to unlocking smarts so many times is hard
work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let your ideas be second-hand, and if possible tenth-hand, for then they will
be far removed from that disturbing element--direct observation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Avoid it and they will become just that.</p>
