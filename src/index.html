            <p>Welcome,</p>
            <p>
              This site serves as a project archive and journal. It's intended
              to be useful to the reader and I hope it proves to be so over
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's also intended to be positive. There is enough negativity on
              social media already to last folks several lifetimes. I don't want
              that here. Nevertheless, I'd be remiss if I didn't make a few
              somewhat negative claims up front.
            </p>
            <p>
              The modern programming landscape is fraught with issues. On the
              whole, quality is down significantly, and nearly all web solutions
              are slow, bloated, and over-engineered. We can do better.
            </p>
            <p>
              This site strives to be a place for pragmatic, sensible ideas.
              <i>Strives</i> to be. I can always do better as well, but what I'd
              like to communicate is that there is still a need for
              craftsmanship, and that the software industry can be improved by a
              "do more with less" mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope that you find your time here enjoyable and can take
              something worthwhile from this content.
            </p>
            <p>
              All the best,<br />
              - Luke
