            <p>Welcome,</p>

            <p>
              This site is a collection of projects, notes, and ongoing work. It
              serves as both an archive and a journal containing a record of
              ideas explored and lessons learned.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m a generalist programmer by inclination, with a professional
              background in web development. Working on the web has given me a
              broad view of the modern software landscape and an appreciation
              for clarity, performance, and maintainability.
            </p>

            <p>
              Software today is powerful, but often more complex than it needs
              to be. I’m interested in building pragmatic, well-reasoned
              solutions that prioritize simplicity. Craftsmanship still matters,
              and I believe a “do more with less” mindset can meaningfully
              improve the tools we build and depend on.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you find something here that proves practically useful, then
              the site has done its job.
            </p>
