# The Internet and the False Hope of Easy Answers

May 31, 2024

I had the sudden urge recently to Google a trivial matter such as, "How to read
more books," as if there were some profound insight to that query. "Read more,"
of course is the answer here.

It's a silly question, but it's something I assume most of us have done a number
of times. In the moment, it feels right -- my thinking at the time being that
there may be some unknown habit I'm partaking in that could be interfering with
my ability to make adequate time for reading. Hindsight being what it is, this
assumption could very well be correct, with internet browsing being the
unfortunate habit I am so earnestly seeking to eradicate.

It's an unfortunate consequence of having a world of information readily
available. It feels as though you may be able to find some nugget of information
that will be an invaluable resource to help you along the path you are on.

Over time, though, I've come to realize that the best information comes from
direct observation -- experience. E.M. Forster warned about the undervaluing of
experience in [_The Machine Stops_](https://amzn.to/3Vnuizy) clear back in 1909,
before the internet was even dreamed of.

Direct experience, of course, should hold a far greater position in our minds
than second-hand tips and tricks, although it can be hard to convince yourself
otherwise in the moment.

How do you read more books?

Become a better reader.

How do you become a better reader?

Read.

I'm sure an entire tome could be written here regarding first-principled
thinking.

It's that direct observation, that direct experience, that propels you forward.
It requires the most work, but reaps the greatest reward. It's rewarding.

Remember that the path you are on is _your_ path. Searching for advice so
readily can easily pull you away from that path. The internet is many things,
but a place of nuance, it is not. The extremes are pulled to the surface, and
the solutions to most problems are not found in extremes, but in nuance -- in
outputs highly dependent upon their inputs and the variables of the problem at
hand.

My question was a lazy question, one whose sole purpose was to make the going
easier. If you get out what you put in, what good are such questions? Instead,
let the practice lead the theory. Learn by discovery. Seek out primary sources.
Let narratives be the supplement, not the diet.

Speaking of primary sources, what comes to mind is a passage from Isaac Asimov's
[_Foundation_](https://amzn.to/4c4ncWu), in which Salvor Hardin criticizes the
Encyclopedists for having too much blind faith in the how things are written to
be.

Are books always primary sources? No. But my point here is that we so readily
dismiss work-involved tasks for a distilled summary or ready-made internet
opinion. Here is the part where you say, "Gotcha!" and point a judgemental
finger at this article, and of course there's some truth there, but nonetheless,
I'll continue.

When in doubt, the best way to move forward is to simply get to work. Out of the
work will come the insights, the tricks of the trade, the invaluable informative
resources such as I was trying to extract undeservedly.

Work smarter, not harder, but the key to unlocking smarts so many times is hard
work.

Avoid it and they will become just that.
